The ones I've digitised from Sept 1891 seem to be from the Marine Biological Laboratory (Plymouth Hoe Observatory, 36 m AMSL). July to October 1892 are missing (either I didn't image them or they are missing from the logbooks). The earlier 1870s records I sent you were taken by Dr John Merrifield at the Navigation School, 13.5 Gascoyne Place, 1 km to the north of the Hoe, 23 m AMSL.
