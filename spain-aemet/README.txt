Daily min/max pressure values extracted from AEMET Open Data. The nearest hour is given, along with pressure value.

Sometimes min pressure is larger than max pressure = both values deleted
Sometimes min and max pressure given same time = both values retained
Sometimes hour is given as 'various' = pressure value deleted

No regular observation time data is openly available.
